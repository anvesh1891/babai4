1. Subsequence and permutations of a string of non repeating charcters.
2. Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
[1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
3a. Reverse bits of an 32 bit unsigned integer
for example
x = 3,
Input- 00000000000000000000000000000011 
=>        Output-11000000000000000000000000000000
return 3221225472
3b.Given an array of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value. Report the minimum XOR value.
Examples : 
Input 
0 2 5 7 
Output 
2 (0 XOR 2) 
Input 
0 4 7 9 
Output 
3 (4 XOR 7)

Constraints: 
2 <= N <= 100 000 
0 <= A[i] <= 1 000 000 000

Question 4. Remove duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Note that even though we want you to return the new length, make sure to change the original array as well in place

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

Given input array A = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2].

Question 5. You are given with an array of 1s and 0s. And you are given with an integer M, which signifies number of flips allowed.
Find the position of zeros which when flipped will produce maximum continuous series of 1s.

For this problem, return the indices of maximum continuous series of 1s in order.
Input : Array = {1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 } M = 1 Output : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
If there are multiple possible solutions, return the sequence which has the minimum start index.


Question 6. You are given a string. The only operation allowed is to insert characters in the beginning of the string. How many minimum characters are needed to be inserted to make the string a palindrome string

Example:
Input: ABC
Output: 2
Input: AACECAAAA
Output: 2

Question 7. A long array A[] is given to you. There is a sliding window of size w which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the w numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves rightwards by one position. You have to find the maximum for each window. The following example will give you more clarity.

Example :

The array is [1 3 -1 -3 5 3 6 7], and w is 3.

Window positionMax  [1 3 -1] -3 5 3 6 731 [3 -1 -3] 5 3 6 731 3 [-1 -3 5] 3 6 751 3 -1 [-3 5 3] 6 751 3 -1 -3 [5 3 6] 761 3 -1 -3 5 [3 6 7]7

Input: A long array A[], and a window width w
Output: An array B[], B[i] is the maximum value of from A[i] to A[i+w-1]
Requirement: Find a good optimal way to get B[i]

 

Note: If w > length of the array


Question 7.

Rahul and Ankit are the only two waiters in Royal Restaurant. Today, the restaurant received N orders. The amount of tips may differ when handled by different waiters, if Rahul takes the ith order, he would be tipped Ai rupees and if Ankit takes this order, the tip would be Bi rupees.
In order to maximize the total tip value they decided to distribute the order among themselves. One order will be handled by one person only. Also, due to time constraints Rahul cannot take more than X orders and Ankit cannot take more than Y orders. It is guaranteed that X + Y is greater than or equal to N, which means that all the orders can be handled by either Rahul or Ankit. Find out the maximum possible amount of total tip money after processing all the orders.


Input:

•    The first line contains one integer, number of test cases.
•    The second line contains three integers N, X, Y.
•    The third line contains N integers. The ithinteger represents Ai.
•    The fourth line contains N integers. The ithinteger represents Bi.

 

Output:
Print a single integer representing the maximum tip money they would receive.
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N; X + Y ≥ N
1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 104

 

Example:

Input:

2
5 3 3
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
8 4 4
1 4 3 2 7 5 9 6 
1 2 3 6 5 4 9 8

 

Output:

21
43

Question 8. 

Today's question
Find sub-string with given power
Given a string of lowercase alphabets, the task is to find indexes of a substring with given power. Assume power of a to be 1, b to be 2, c to be 3 and so on. Here the power of a substring means the sum of the powers of all the characters in that particular substring.

Examples:

Input: str = “geeksforgeeks” power = 36
Output: Substring from index 3 to 5 has power 36
Explanation: k = 11, s = 19, f = 6 i.e. k + s + e = 36.

Input: str = “aditya” power = 2
Output: No substring with given power exists.
